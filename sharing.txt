Sharing Guide: Naming and Structuring Conventions
1. Naming Convention
Controller

Resource Controllers: These should have plural names as they typically manage multiple instances of a model, covering all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Generic Controllers: These are used for specific, non-CRUD operations and can be singular. They usually handle more specialized or aggregated tasks across various models.

2. Definitions
Services

Services encapsulate the core business logic of an application, separate from the user interface and data access layers. They typically handle computations, processing, and the application's rules but do not directly manage database operations.
Services also manage connections and interactions with third-party applications, serving as a bridge between the application and external APIs.


Traits

Traits provide reusable methods that can be included in multiple classes. They are intended to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles without inheriting from a parent class.
Traits should not substitute the functionality of services or helpers; their purpose is to add supplementary methods to classes.


Helpers

Helper functions are utility functions that handle tasks not directly associated with the core business logic or database interactions. They are typically used for:
Formatting dates
Transforming and manipulating data
Helpers should be lightweight and not become bloated with excessive logic or capabilities.


Repositories

Repositories abstract the logic required to access data sources. They provide a collection of operations available on a data source that the rest of the application can use.
Control of repositories is typically managed via interfaces, ensuring a contract for repository operations and facilitating easier testing and maintenance.


Interfaces

Interfaces define contract outlines for sets of functionalities. They help in enforcing a structure for classes that implement them, promoting a coding standard and ensuring consistency in method signatures and return types.


Resources (Laravel)

Laravel resources are transformation layers that make it easier to convert models and model collections into JSON. They provide a way to uniformly present and format the API responses sent to the client.

3. React
useState

useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. It allows you to track state in a function component and is used for declaring state variables.


useEffect

useEffect is a Hook that manages side-effects in function components. It is used for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

4. Testing (PESTS)
PESTS (PHP Environment Structure Testing Solution)

This section would detail the practices and tools for effectively testing the software using the PEST framework, focusing on streamlined and human-readable testing syntax. Key concepts include test organization, mocking, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.
